    <h1>The Tiger</h1>
    
    <p>The tiger is the largest member of the felid (cat) family. They sport long, thick reddish coats with white bellies and white and black tails. Their heads, bodies, tails and limbs have narrow black, brown or gray stripes. There were once nine subspecies of tigers: Bengal, Siberian, Indochinese, South Chinese, Sumatran, Malayan, Caspian, Javan and Bali. Of these, the last three are extinct, one is extinct in the wild, and the rest are endangered</p>

    <h2>Population</h2>

    <p>In the early 1900s, there were around 100,000 tigers throughout their range. Today, an estimated total of around 3,000-4,500 exist in the wild. Below is a breakdown of tiger numbers by subspecies.

            Bengal tiger: Less than 2,000
            Indochinese tiger: 750-1,300
            Siberian tiger: Around 450
            Sumatran tiger: 400-500
            Malayan tiger: 600-800
            South Chinese tiger: Extinct in the wild
            Caspian tiger: Extinct
            Javan tiger: Extinct
            Bali tiger: Extinct</p>

    <h2>Behavior</h2>

    <p>Tigers occupy a variety of habitats from tropical forests, evergreen forests, woodlands and mangrove swamps to grasslands, savannah and rocky country. They are mostly nocturnal (more active at night) and are ambush predators that rely on the camouflage their stripes provide. Tigers use their body weight to knock prey to the ground and kills with a bite to the neck. They are also very good swimmers and have been known to kill prey while swimming.

            Tigers essentially live solitary lives, except during mating season and when females bear young. They are usually fiercely territorial and have and mark their large home ranges.</p>

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>

        <li>Tigers are the largest cat species in the world and the third-largest carnivore on land--only polar and brown bears are larger</li>
        <li>A tiger's tail is about three feet long and helps them balance when making tight turns.</li>
        <li>Unlike most big cats, tigers are powerful swimmers and have been known to swim great distances to hunt or cross rivers. Young tigers often play in water and adults will lounge in streams or lakes to stay cool during the heat of the day.</li>
        <li>You can hear a tiger's roar from up to two miles away. Tiger vocalizations include roaring, growling, hissing, moaning and chuffing.</li>
